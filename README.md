# Titanic-Survival-Exploration with Decision Trees

## Description

In this optional project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.


Recall that these are the various features present for each passenger on the ship:
- Pclass: Socio-economic class (1 = Upper class; 2 = Middle class; 3 = Lower class)
- Name: Name of passenger
- Sex: Sex of the passenger
- Age: Age of the passenger (Some entries contain NaN)
- SibSp: Number of siblings and spouses of the passenger aboard
- Parch: Number of parents and children of the passenger aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number of the passenger
- Fare: Fare paid by the passenger
- Cabin Cabin number of the passenger (Some entries contain NaN)
- Embarked: Port of embarkation of the passenger (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
(Target variable) Survived: Outcome of survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
